Decode and transmit RTTY, PSK31, and other ham radio digital modes with a familiar chat interface. Free, open source, and no ads.

## Description
<!-- 4,000 characters max -->
Amateur Digital turns your iPhone or iPad into a full-featured digital mode station for amateur radio. Connect a USB audio interface between your device and your HF transceiver, and you're on the air.

SUPPORTED MODES
- RTTY (45.45, 50, 75 Baud) — Classic radio teletype using 5-bit Baudot code
- PSK31 (31.25 Baud) — Narrowband phase-shift keying for keyboard-to-keyboard QSOs
- BPSK63 (62.5 Baud) — Faster PSK for stronger signals
- QPSK31 (31.25 Baud) — Four-phase PSK with 2x throughput
- QPSK63 (62.5 Baud) — Fastest PSK variant for excellent conditions

MULTI-CHANNEL DECODING
Monitor multiple signals simultaneously across the audio passband. The app automatically detects and decodes transmissions on different frequencies, displaying each conversation in its own channel.

IMESSAGE-STYLE INTERFACE
A familiar chat interface makes digital modes approachable. Sent messages appear as blue bubbles, transmissions in progress are orange, and decoded signals appear as incoming messages. Swipe to reveal timestamps.

AUTOMATIC GRID SQUARE
Uses GPS to determine your Maidenhead grid locator automatically — perfect for portable and field operation. Enter your callsign once and it's ready for every QSO.

BUILT-IN FREQUENCY REFERENCE
Quick reference for digital mode calling frequencies on all HF bands from 160m through 6m, including WARC bands.

ICLOUD SYNC
Your callsign, grid locator, and mode settings sync across all your devices via iCloud.

FREE AND OPEN SOURCE
No ads, no in-app purchases, no subscriptions, no tracking. Amateur Digital is open source and built by a ham for hams.

REQUIREMENTS
- iPhone or iPad running iOS 17 or later
- USB audio interface (Lightning or USB-C)
- HF transceiver with SSB (USB) capability
- Valid amateur radio license
